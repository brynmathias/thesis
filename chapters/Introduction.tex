The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) \cite{Benedikt:823808} is a proton-proton collider which is situated in the Large Electron Positron
(LEP) tunnel approximately 100 m under the franco-swiss border. Design center of mass energy is 14 TeV with an instantaneous
luminosity of $ 1 \times 10$e$^{34}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. However during 2011 the center of mass energy was 7 TeV and the maximum
luminosity was $ 5 \times 10$e$^{33}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$.
To achieve this high energy and high beam current the LHC uses superconducting niobium-titanium magnets, cooled to a temperature of 
1.8 Kelvin, that produce a maximum field strength of 8.36 Tesla.

\textbf{TODO: we might well need some more stuff about the LHC its self in here!}

Situated around the LHC ring are four detectors, two general detectors ATLAS \cite{Akesson:1999uv} and CMS (see
Chapter~\ref{cha:the_cms_detector} for a detailed discussion of the CMS detector) \cite{Friedl:1140134}\cite{Wulz:vf} which are  designed to measure the standard model to high precision and search for new physics. The LHC beauty experiment 
\cite{Rademacker:2005tx} is designed to study at previously unattainable precision the decays of heavy quark 
flavors, both to measure the standard model couplings and to search for beyond the standard model (BSM) physical processes. Finally
the ALICE \cite{Alessandro:2006ht} experiment is designed to run when the LHC is running in it's secondary mode where rather than
proton bunches, lead ions are collided, in an effort to study the quark-gluon plasma.

\paragraph{New physics} % (fold)
\label{par:new_physics}
Whilst the theory of the standard model and of new physics models will be discussed in chapter~\ref{cha:theory} it is prudent to 
discuss the observable features of these models with regard to design requirements for the general purpose detectors.
